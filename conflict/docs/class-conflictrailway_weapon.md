### Description
&quot;These large artillery devices are designed to be mounted on railway cars, and often formed part of an armoured train. The first use of railway weapons dates back to the American Civil War, and they were extensively used in the First and Second World War. However, the rise of the aeroplane effectively ended the usefulness of the railway gun, and they were replaced by systems that delivered the payload by aircraft, rocket or missile.&quot;
