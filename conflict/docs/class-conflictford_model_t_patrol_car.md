### Description
&quot;At the beginning of the First World War Henry Ford refused to let his cars be used in combat conditions. Eventually Ford changed his mind and the Model T was used as a patrol car. The British purchased about 19,000 of these cars during the war. Armed with Lewis guns, the Model T Patrol Car, was used by the British Army in France but they were particularly effective in Palestine, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Libya. The car was used for raiding, reconnaissance and in supporting the cavalry.
