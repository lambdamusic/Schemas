### Description
&quot;&amp;quot;The dreadnought was the predominant type of 20th-century battleship. The first of the kind, the Royal Navy&#39;s Dreadnought had such an impact when launched in 1906 that battleships built after her were referred to as &#39;dreadnoughts&#39;, and earlier battleships became known as pre-dreadnoughts. Her design had two revolutionary features: an &#39;all-big-gun&#39; armament scheme and steam turbine propulsion.&amp;quot;&quot;
