Counterexample
	- seen foundamentally as an example
	- we take it as a distinct entity because of its diffusione nel discorso filosofico. An alterantive approach potrebbe definirlo in termini dell'uso retorico che si fa di un esempio filosofico
	- from wikipedia: In logic, and especially in its applications to mathematics and philosophy, a counterexample is an exception to a proposed general rule. For example, consider the proposition "all students are lazy". Because this statement makes the claim that a certain property (laziness) holds for all students, even a single example of a diligent student will prove it false. Thus, any hard-working student is a counterexample to "all students are lazy". More precisely, a counterexample is a specific instance of the falsity of a universal quantification (a "for all" statement).
